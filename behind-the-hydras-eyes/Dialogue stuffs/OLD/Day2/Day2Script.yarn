Text From Boss: Hey Dave, I've started getting emails about the project.
Text From Boss: ...locals, NIMBYs, do-gooders, you know the types.
Text From Boss: Anyway, do me a favour and placate them however you canâ€”I'm rerouting all queries to you now.
Text From Boss: If there's anything you're not sure how to answer, just direct them to externalenquiries@forwardgreen.co.uk.

Alex: Everything's chugging along. Our agents in Mexico are finishing negotiations with the local government,
Alex: and it sounds like the building contractors are happy to begin as soon as the paperworks all ready.
Alex: Construction costs are expected to be slightly higher than the original forcast, though, mostly due to materials like lithium.
Alex: Various protests that have stopped mine expansions at our suppliers haven't helped. Still, what matters is that we're on track.

Jen: My counterpart in Mexico says the poster campaign I sent over is in full swing now
Jen: Imagine, whole towns plastered in them. "ForwadGreen, a green future you can trust" as far as the eye can see
Jen: We've also gone ahead with buying up most of the radio ads. We'll be all they can see, all they can hear.
Jen: Soon they'll be begging for more turbines!

Boss: Congratulations! it's brilliant work we're doing, I hope you realise that. You're really playing a pivotal role in the development of ForwardGreen's vision for a better planet.
Boss: And another congratulations for leading the crew for over a month now. As captain of the whole vessel, I thought I'd check in on my first mate's progress. So, Alex tells me that you picked a location pretty sharpish. Where did you settle on?

-> San Dionisio 
    <<set $location to "San Dionisio">>
    
-> Xabizende
    <<set $location to "Xabizende">>
    
-> San Pedro Hullotepec
    <<set $location to "San Pedro Hullotepec">>

// <<if ($location == $choice)>>

<<if $location =="San Dionisio">>
    Boss: Across the strait? I know the area well, great choice. I've spent more than one happy summer moored not far along the coast. The water is crystal.
    <<jump BossMultiple>>
<<endif>>
    
<<if $location =="Xabizende">>
    Boss: The old town? What a lovely place to pull out of the past and into a green future. I've already been of course; lot's of people in need of jobs there.
    <<jump BossMultiple>>
<<endif>>

<<if $location =="San Pedro Hullotepec">>
    Boss: Along the sand bar eh? What a lovely silhoutte they'll make against the sunset next time I'm sailing around there.
    <<jump BossMultiple>>
<<endif>>
// <<elseif ($location != $choice)>>

// *Your boss rustles through some papers on his desk*
// Boss: "Ah no, maybe that would have been an acceptable choice but we setteld with another. Did I overrule you? I'm sure I made the best decision for the company.

    Boss: Protests? There's been some hippies at the lithium mines in Portugal, but that's not really our problem. The Mexican landowners are too paid off to protest. Don't worry about it kid.
