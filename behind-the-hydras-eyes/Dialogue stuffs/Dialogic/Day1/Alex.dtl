Alex: …oh, sorry! I got sucked into this spreadsheet. How can I help?
Project lead, you say? Nice to meet you boss! I'm Alex, I do all the odd bits. Where’ve you joined us from?
- I'm fresh outta uni!
	Alex: New blood, eh? Well, I can't say anyone else on the team is much older.
- I'm an ex-teacher!
	Alex: I should've guessed, our recruitment team are drowning in those fleeing the education sector.
- Little England Petroleum
	Alex: Ah, one of our sponsors. You know how things work then.

Alex:  Well, we're happy to have you anyway. I'm just gonna finish this and then I can show you the project, so have a look around, grab a cup of tea or something, and then come back.
