Corkboard: Various important notices are pinned by the boss's door\: the number of the first aid officer, a sheet to report accidents, details of a counselling service.
- Inspect the accident sheet
	Corkboard: The first line is crossed out\: "I was in Amsterdam this weekend and fell into the canal \:("
	Dave: I'm glad I wasn't here to have the conversation that followed that.
	Corkboard: The second line notes a trip over a cable, the third a sprained back from moving office furniture.
	Corkboard: A forth line has been crossed out by a thick pen, now unreadable. After that the sheet's blank.

- Look at the counselling service.
	Corkboard: "All employees are entitled to a single half hour counselling session per yearâ€”that's how important mental health is to us!"
	Dave: Wow, knowing that ForwardGreen cares so much about us makes me feel better already.
	Dave: I should probably save my session 'till I really need it... a mindset that'll guarantee I never use it.
