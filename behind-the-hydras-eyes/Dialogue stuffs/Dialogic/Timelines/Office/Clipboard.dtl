label Quarter One
Clipboard: Our Green office project! To help energise our workers and liven up our office, we're asking people to foster some plants!
Clipboard: Plant fostering can be cited in your annual review as proof of living up to our brand values\: loyalty, organisation, consistency.
Clipboard: Simply write your name below and take a plant. At the end of each quarter you'll get a reward for the plants you've kept alive!
- Sign and take a plant
	Dave: Suspiciously vague about this reward, but sure.

	Dave: I'd feel too guilty if it died; I'll leave the foster care to Jen.
