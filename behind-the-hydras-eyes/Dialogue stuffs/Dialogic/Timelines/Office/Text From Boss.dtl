"Text From Boss": Bzzt! Bzzt!
"Text From Boss": Hey Dave, sorry for the text, things are a bit hectic on my end so I can't greet you in person.
"Text From Boss": Welcome though! I've had a desk set up for you near the door. At the minute your team is quite small, so it won't take you long to introduce yourself.
"Text From Boss": I'll see you later today, and I've put a performance meeting in your calender with me at the end of the month. Catch you later!
