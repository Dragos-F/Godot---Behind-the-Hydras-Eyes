Alex: What a nightmare getting in today, right?
Alex: I was at Shingle station this morning when the whole line just got cancelled. I tried hopping on a bus, but the works on the burst mains pipe down the road are still going.
Dave: Yeah, I got the Annabel line in, things were pretty smooth, and the walk over wasn't too bad...
Alex: It just felt like I couldn't get anywhereâ€”delays, announcements, traffic, delays, announcements, traffic...
Alex: It's crazy when your daily commute just overrun by construction. Makes it unrecognisable sometimes.
- That sounds rough
- I used to have a long commute...
Alex: Back to work though, I've got a bunch of compliance letters to file away to the portfolio projects.
Alex: Richard sent them through and he said I gotta help him out since a few of the team have now left.
Alex: Hope that's alright wih you?
- Oh, yeah, whatever the company needs	
	Alex: Yeah, thanks. At least it gets me away from filing architectural plans.
- I'm sure he can find his own time to do that, I need you on Lagoon Breeze.	
	Alex: Oh, yep, sure. I'll ....send the portfolio back to him and tell him you're keeping me busy.
- What's been happening in legal?	
	Alex: Ah. Me and a couple of the boys from legal used to go play pool every other Saturday at the Wellington.
	Alex: One of them had their probation extended twice, and then let go last week for "Not embodying company values"
	Alex: The other is suspended and going through a disciplinary for coming into work drunk 6 times in 4 weeks.
	Dave: Right.... that sounds like Richard's having a rough time then
	Alex: Ah, I think he was looking to get rid of them to be honest. Never liked Torvil and Dean
	Dave: : ...Torvill and Dean?
	Alex: Yeah, the guys from Legal.
	Dave: Right... I'll get back to my emails then.

Alex: We're not far off the land settlement being complete. Anything you need before the EoQ?	
- Do we have some sort of EoQ Report?	
	Alex: Ah.... *Alex pretends to click through some tabs of the shared company intranet*
	Alex: No, don't think so. We don't really make them. Big Pat tends to do them and then present them at the shareholder meetings
	Alex: The things you hear about those meetings by the way....and the nights out after...all true.
- I just wanted to check in with you and see if I could support anything	
	Well, I wouldn't wanna take you away from your important management. Whatever I've got is less important than your business.
	Plus, I don't wanna sound like I'm struggling. Gotta keep it up for that summer bonus.
- Is the paperwork you deal with all in order?	
	Alex: I seem to be getting complaints about inaccurate EIP's, incomplete files with local authorities and such. Is everything good on your end?
	Alex: All good with me! All that sounds like either Jen's problem, or i don't know, probably Legal and compliance? 
	Alex: I'm mostly just here to keep all the paperwork in check for the project development. That being said, don't ask me for copies of anything.

Dave: I've got this email from a "Nayeli?" Do yoou know anything about her?
Alex: *Alex makes a pained groan sound*
Alex: Ugh, not her again
Alex: She got involved with a different project in the area. It was originally going to be a quarry, mostly for gravel production to one of our investor's developments that needed more supply.
Alex: She was quite the pain. Did I mention the guy we had before you? That quit after dealing with a bunch of complaints?
Alex: Yeah, she would drive Nigel crazy. I saw one of the emails she sent. Super dramatic, just absolute bollocks. 
- She seemd quite passionate about it all.
	Alex: Well, if she was serious about it, she would attend the local council meetings we have to organise anyway
	Alex: No point in her typing up some flowery threats she can't enact anyway. There's proper channels for these sorts of complaints
- Yeah, I guess she seems a bit eccentric
	Alex: She's definitely weird. She represents some group of deranged nature lovers, that pray to forest spirits or whatever
	Alex: I just wouldn't take anything from her seriously

Dave: Do you know about this "Entreprenurial alliance" that's just messaged me? Or a Mr. Perez?
Alex: Oh, yeah. Mr Perez is one of the landowners that we purchased our lots from. The alliance is largely an investment vehicle for the richest in the area.
Alex: They're a very informal group, since most companies proposing megaprojects in the region, wind farms or otherwise, won't make deals with organised groups.
Alex: It's a very divide-and-conquer mentality to the locals. Anyway, because of this the Alliance mostly just helps landlords acquire land, rather than negotiating for them.
Alex: Traditionally about three quarters of land around the lagoon was communal, with locals resisting privatisation. This has been rapidly changing though.
Alex: Forty years ago the guy in charge of protecting the communal lands was assassinated, and the role has remained empty since due to political intimidation.
Alex: Landowners and foreign companies launched legal battles to claim swathes of the communal land.
Alex:  Buying communal land and selling it to international firms is how Mr Perez made his fortune.
Dave: Wait, we're building on dodgily obtained communal land?
Alex: I didn't say it was dodgy; Mr Perez obtained the land, legally, and sold it to a willing buyer, legally. And we have the capital to put the land to do more good.
- Okay, I guess I'm happy we're doing the right thing...
	Alex: Don't let fixation on the perfect hinder the doing of good. More green energy can only be a positive, surely.
- Couldn't we have done it in a fairer way?
	Alex: The moral question is above my paygrade, but it seems better to me to good good than handwring about the risks.
- Legal isn't the same as moral. We should have built elsewhere.
	Alex: Unfortunately for your newfound moral compass, we've already started now. Don't make the boss think you've got cold feet.

Alex:We are waiting to be in possession of almost a small state's worth of land, as well as local government ceading some coastline, seabed territory we'll also merge into the project.
Alex:And I'm the lucky sod processing it all...
- Can I help with anything?
	Alex: Ah, don't stress. That's what you pay me to do. I'm just remarking on the influx of it all in the last two weeks. What you could really do is clone me twice over and put us all to work!

- Yeah, great to hear!
	Alex: Sure is. Good to know we're spending money on the things that matter
- I haven't gotten to my emails yet.
	Alex: Ah, well, I won't spoil anything then. Good news on the horizon though!
Alex: Anyway, I think Q2 is off to a good start!
Alex: I haven't heard any complaints from senior management, and all my spreadsheets are mostly green, so that must be a good sign.
Alex: Happy with how the projects moving along?
- Yep, Construction should start soon, so add that to the green spreadsheet
	Alex: Glad to hear! There was some murmurings about local pressure to reopen negotiations, but it seems quashed now.
- A few snags but we're marching on now
	Alex: Yeah, I did catch murmurings of some pressure on the government to renegotiate. But I'm glad we're moving ahead with approval now.
- Wait, let's go back to the Olu news....
	Alex: No need to worry. The marketing budget got approved, just another milestone in the development.
Alex: Just picture the turbines up and spinning, generating the renewable good stuff. Let yourself feel good about doing your part.
Alex: Or if not then, hey, maybe think of the potential summer bonus! Whatever works for you.
- Summer bonus?
	Alex: Investors like ground being broken without much fuss, so expect some grease for your wheels as thanks now building is set to begin.
- I've never really spent too long thinking about a turbine.
	Dave: The view from up there must be pretty nice.
	Alex: Oh yeah. We did a site visit at spot in Spain, and got to climb to the maintenance platform.
	Alex: A week earlier someone apparently got trapped at the top when the main rotor caught fire, but they cleaned the place up real well.

Alex: ...and it sounds like the building contractors are happy to begin as soon as the paperwork is readyâ€”or even earlier.
Alex: The price of certain raw goods, particularly lithium and cobalt, is all over the place, so construction costs will be a bit higher than forecasted. But that's fine.

- Protests at the mines?

	- That's bad...right?
		Alex: Sure. Still, our turbines need these materials, so someone's got to supply them.
	- I feel like I detect irony...
		Alex: That shiny new climate solutions rely on exploitative extractivism that produce huge amounts of CO2 and environmental damage?
		Dave: Yeah, that.
		Alex: Well, mulling over irony's not your job. Just make Mr Moore money, and you get to say you've fought climate change in the process.
