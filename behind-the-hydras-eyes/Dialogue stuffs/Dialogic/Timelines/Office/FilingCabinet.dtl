FilingCabinet: The drawer glides open with the well-oiled precision of a jet rolling down a runway. Inside is row after row of neat, tidy manilla folders, swaying seductively at you from the motion.
FilingCabinet: "Pick me" whispers a folder titled "Plans to remove asbestos in office". "No, pick me", whispers another titled "Legal battle against the people of the Western Sahara".
FilingCabinet: You resist their siren song, running your thumb along the documents until you find the ones relevant to Project Lagoon Breeze.
